{"text": " okay starting my first scene intro here we go I what up my man sports we are driving home right now from watching the tennis little today and I don't know looking back on my week I'm trying to see how it went it probably wasn't the best med man week I'm off next week on vacation so very excited for that going to Muskoka so that'll be fun hopefully gonna play some golf hang out by the pool with the kiddos have a little med juice you know I'm saying and then yeah so actually a bunch of things went on I feel like this week was just like all about missing you know I don't know I feel like everything I practiced I was missing and it's just like none of this stuff was going good work wasn't going good that good like tennis the week started like I was gonna grind on the serve a couple days it didn't go good and then I hurt my wrists one day so I haven't really practiced much since then and it's kind of feeling better now so I don't know I'm gonna try to tape it up and play tomorrow I got two ladder matches because my ladders ending so yeah that's tennis not bad right now it's okay and then yeah maybe next scene we're gonna start right now we'll talk about my new ITF dreams but very exciting news in tennis here we have a tournament going on at the club I'm playing at so it's an ITF masters and I asked the tournament organizer or whatever who was there all about it and what it is it's actually like a pro tournament that basically anyone could sign up for you just got to be like an ITF member but that's not too hard to do and yeah you can play like these crazy good people and apparently the most competitive division is the 30 plus for men okay so you know I'm 34 now maybe if I like keep training keep working with Colin keep staying fit maybe we could play in the ITF when I'm like 37 and I don't know I don't just want to play you know I can mean I can go get dunked six nothing six nothing right now but that's not fun no no no med man's gonna play and he's gonna go for the first round win that's what we need okay I'm not I'm not saying I can win right away in three years but like I want to go for like first round win battle in the second I'll take a loss there you know but that's a good step onto the international stage you know I was asking the tournament person all about it this is pro okay ITF hosts Wimbledon okay so Wimbledon's like she was saying they host all the majors this is a 200 level event okay not like ATP 200 but like ITF 200 crazy so that's pretty exciting uh let's end that scene let's end the tennis and start seeing and yeah another one soccer this week my lesson with that is I haven't played soccer actually well I've been kind of like kicking about here and there once a week just for the past little bit but before that I haven't been playing for like 10 years so honestly it feels good I'm doing the thing that I just love doing the most just going kicking around a ball and like doing shooting practice right now you know I love hitting free kicks I love shooting the ball especially when you have a nice field like I got that artificial turf on this morning if you're watching my stories but oh man that was sick you know and I don't know reflection on that though was more more on like I don't know it's nice going back to something you know it's like I feel like soccer this is my story with soccer I basically played in university and like that was sick but I was on the bench okay that was fine like I don't know I scored one goal whatever I played against like I played with really good players so like looking back I can't even complain but uh like they were just better than me at the time and maybe a mental thing but yeah it's nice I just kind of stopped playing after that like I just just soccer was just like uh I'm just like so competitive and then it was like that was kind of like I didn't really have any super competitive soccer so then I took that to golf you know and I got really into golf for a while and now I'm gonna get really into tennis so that's kind of my plan it's kind of fun to have a goal like I don't know if I have this like dream stupid goal of senior PGA okay but now I maybe have this crazy goal I went a first round when I'm 30 37 38 years old in the 30 plus division like I want to pump you know men and women start the men and women singles are tomorrow today it was women's doubles and men's doubles that's what I saw but you know the real stuff is the singles you know so that'll be fun to watch I'm pretty excited to see that tomorrow hopefully I can swing by but more importantly my niece has tennis tomorrow so that's the biggest thing going down that's the biggest thing going down with the club tomorrow and then I got to tape my hand hopefully that's okay for my two ladder matches because yeah I haven't I oh man the ladder ends on Monday and I still have two matches to play my wrist is hurting so yeah we'll see we'll see we'll see so but got to keep grinding if I want to go up I have to win these next two and they're the best they're the other two good guys in my group too so got it hopefully my hands okay it's it's not feeling amazing today I can grip it fine it's just like get it's just like kind of that where you have to be careful with it you know so maybe I need some CB help you know look at it swollen hours hours whatever anyways and that scene and yeah I don't know any other motivation oh start seeing oh my god guys huge update on Amazon okay thank you guys for all the clicks earlier on my story this week okay okay we got like 18 clicks and we made how many dollars thank you y'all know who you are for the orders okay and we made 75 cents everyone so we are officially we haven't got paid yet except to make $50 to get paid but we made 75 cents okay I'll show the dashboards whoo anyways that was fun so thank you I'm you know prime day coming up everyone so get ready for it spam link spam link spam remember this for later link spam okay and scene and start scene why did I say start scene right now is because my video clipper I don't know that I'd tell you guys about my video AI clipper I'm trying to build so I'm trying to make a video AI clipper but the only way I know how to do it is through like voice so by me saying start scene I'm starting my clip and then I'm gonna be like hey end scene so anyways we'll see if that works so we'll plug that in one day and fingers crossed so anyways we'll see if that works but that's what I'm working on right now so trying to make something to like easily clip these videos so I don't need to do anything and then maybe like turn that into some product hopefully AI come on this one random app called clearly clearly clearly they just they just raised 15 million dollars and it was like the exact same thing me and my brother-in-law were talking about like two weeks ago we're like yo there's got to be a way to like cheat on things and like if you have AI telling you the answers live while I can hear your like work meeting oh and I think that's what that clearly thing does so wow I just got to come up with the sports version of that that's what I'm thinking you know I just got to come up with the sports version of that uh how does that happen how does it happen people anyone got ideas throw them my way let's just keep vibing let's vibe let's become sports billionaires together you know oh my god my music is really hyping me up right now I got it on my ears I feel it in my bones", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.68, "text": "
