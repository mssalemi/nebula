00:00.000 --> 00:08.680
okay starting my first scene intro here we go I what up my man sports we are

00:08.680 --> 00:15.600
driving home right now from watching the tennis little today and I don't know

00:15.600 --> 00:20.100
looking back on my week I'm trying to see how it went it probably wasn't the

00:20.100 --> 00:25.680
best med man week I'm off next week on vacation so very excited for that going

00:25.680 --> 00:30.420
to Muskoka so that'll be fun hopefully gonna play some golf hang out by the

00:30.420 --> 00:39.780
pool with the kiddos have a little med juice you know I'm saying and then yeah

00:39.780 --> 00:43.260
so actually a bunch of things went on I feel like this week was just like all

00:43.260 --> 00:46.800
about missing you know I don't know I feel like everything I practiced I was

00:46.800 --> 00:50.640
missing and it's just like none of this stuff was going good work wasn't going

00:50.640 --> 00:57.000
good that good like tennis the week started like I was gonna grind on the

00:57.000 --> 01:01.520
serve a couple days it didn't go good and then I hurt my wrists one day so I

01:01.520 --> 01:06.060
haven't really practiced much since then and it's kind of feeling better now so I

01:06.060 --> 01:10.500
don't know I'm gonna try to tape it up and play tomorrow I got two ladder matches

01:10.500 --> 01:16.860
because my ladders ending so yeah that's tennis not bad right now it's okay and

01:16.860 --> 01:28.240
then yeah maybe next scene we're gonna start right now we'll talk about my new

01:28.240 --> 01:36.300
ITF dreams but very exciting news in tennis here we have a tournament going on

01:36.300 --> 01:40.860
at the club I'm playing at so it's an ITF masters and I asked the tournament

01:40.860 --> 01:45.540
organizer or whatever who was there all about it and what it is it's actually like

01:45.540 --> 01:48.780
a pro tournament that basically anyone could sign up for you just got to be

01:48.780 --> 01:53.940
like an ITF member but that's not too hard to do and yeah you can play like

01:53.940 --> 01:57.600
these crazy good people and apparently the most competitive division is the 30

01:57.600 --> 02:04.880
plus for men okay so you know I'm 34 now maybe if I like keep training keep

02:04.880 --> 02:10.860
working with Colin keep staying fit maybe we could play in the ITF when I'm like

02:10.860 --> 02:16.020
37 and I don't know I don't just want to play you know I can mean I can go get

02:16.020 --> 02:20.700
dunked six nothing six nothing right now but that's not fun no no no med man's

02:20.700 --> 02:25.140
gonna play and he's gonna go for the first round win that's what we need okay I'm

02:25.140 --> 02:31.080
not I'm not saying I can win right away in three years but like I want to go for

02:31.080 --> 02:35.860
like first round win battle in the second I'll take a loss there you know but

02:35.860 --> 02:41.260
that's a good step onto the international stage you know I was asking the

02:41.260 --> 02:47.320
tournament person all about it this is pro okay ITF hosts Wimbledon okay so

02:47.320 --> 02:52.240
Wimbledon's like she was saying they host all the majors this is a 200 level

02:52.240 --> 02:59.920
event okay not like ATP 200 but like ITF 200 crazy so that's pretty exciting

02:59.920 --> 03:07.300
uh let's end that scene let's end the tennis and start seeing and yeah another

03:07.300 --> 03:12.300
one soccer this week my lesson with that is I haven't played soccer actually well

03:12.300 --> 03:15.820
I've been kind of like kicking about here and there once a week just for the past

03:15.820 --> 03:21.400
little bit but before that I haven't been playing for like 10 years so honestly it

03:21.400 --> 03:25.040
feels good I'm doing the thing that I just love doing the most just going kicking

03:25.040 --> 03:29.900
around a ball and like doing shooting practice right now you know I love hitting

03:29.900 --> 03:34.160
free kicks I love shooting the ball especially when you have a nice field

03:34.160 --> 03:38.760
like I got that artificial turf on this morning if you're watching my stories but

03:38.760 --> 03:46.520
oh man that was sick you know and I don't know reflection on that though was

03:46.520 --> 03:52.580
more more on like I don't know it's nice going back to something you know it's

03:52.580 --> 03:59.420
like I feel like soccer this is my story with soccer I basically played in

03:59.420 --> 04:07.580
university and like that was sick but I was on the bench okay that was fine like I

04:07.580 --> 04:10.920
don't know I scored one goal whatever I played against like I played with really

04:10.920 --> 04:15.380
good players so like looking back I can't even complain but uh like they were just

04:15.380 --> 04:23.800
better than me at the time and maybe a mental thing but yeah it's nice I just

04:23.800 --> 04:29.040
kind of stopped playing after that like I just just soccer was just like uh I'm

04:29.040 --> 04:32.320
just like so competitive and then it was like that was kind of like I didn't

04:32.320 --> 04:35.520
really have any super competitive soccer so then I took that to golf you know and

04:35.520 --> 04:39.960
I got really into golf for a while and now I'm gonna get really into tennis so

04:39.960 --> 04:43.660
that's kind of my plan it's kind of fun to have a goal like I don't know if I have

04:43.660 --> 04:50.340
this like dream stupid goal of senior PGA okay but now I maybe have this crazy

04:50.340 --> 04:56.680
goal I went a first round when I'm 30 37 38 years old in the 30 plus division

04:56.680 --> 05:01.920
like I want to pump you know men and women start the men and women singles are

05:01.920 --> 05:11.480
tomorrow today it was women's doubles and men's doubles that's what I saw but you

05:11.480 --> 05:15.260
know the real stuff is the singles you know so that'll be fun to watch I'm

05:15.260 --> 05:18.480
pretty excited to see that tomorrow hopefully I can swing by but more

05:18.480 --> 05:22.800
importantly my niece has tennis tomorrow so that's the biggest thing going down

05:22.800 --> 05:26.080

05:26.080 --> 05:31.160

but that's what I'm working on right now so trying to make something to like easily

07:43.340 --> 07:47.340
clip these videos so I don't need to do anything and then maybe like turn that

07:47.340 --> 07:54.340
into some product hopefully AI come on this one random app called clearly clearly

07:54.340 --> 07:59.340
