39780	43260	so actually a bunch of things went on I feel like this week was just like all
43260	46800	about missing you know I don't know I feel like everything I practiced I was
46800	50640	missing and it's just like none of this stuff was going good work wasn't going
50640	57000	good that good like tennis the week started like I was gonna grind on the
57000	61520	serve a couple days it didn't go good and then I hurt my wrists one day so I
61520	66060	haven't really practiced much since then and it's kind of feeling better now so I
66060	70500	don't know I'm gonna try to tape it up and play tomorrow I got two ladder matches
70500	76860	because my ladders ending so yeah that's tennis not bad right now it's okay and

88240	96300	ITF dreams but very exciting news in tennis here we have a tournament going on
96300	100860	at the club I'm playing at so it's an ITF masters and I asked the tournament
100860	105540	organizer or whatever who was there all about it and what it is it's actually like
105540	108780	a pro tournament that basically anyone could sign up for you just got to be
108780	113940	like an ITF member but that's not too hard to do and yeah you can play like
113940	117600	these crazy good people and apparently the most competitive division is the 30
117600	124880	plus for men okay so you know I'm 34 now maybe if I like keep training keep
124880	130860	working with Colin keep staying fit maybe we could play in the ITF when I'm like
130860	136020	37 and I don't know I don't just want to play you know I can mean I can go get
136020	140700	dunked six nothing six nothing right now but that's not fun no no no med man's
140700	145140	gonna play and he's gonna go for the first round win that's what we need okay I'm
145140	151080	not I'm not saying I can win right away in three years but like I want to go for
151080	155860	like first round win battle in the second I'll take a loss there you know but
155860	161260	that's a good step onto the international stage you know I was asking the
161260	167320	tournament person all about it this is pro okay ITF hosts Wimbledon okay so
167320	172240	Wimbledon's like she was saying they host all the majors this is a 200 level
172240	179920	event okay not like ATP 200 but like ITF 200 crazy so that's pretty exciting
179920	187300	uh let's end that scene let's end the tennis and start seeing and yeah another
187300	192300	one soccer this week my lesson with that is I haven't played soccer actually well
192300	195820	I've been kind of like kicking about here and there once a week just for the past
195820	201400	little bit but before that I haven't been playing for like 10 years so honestly it
201400	205040	feels good I'm doing the thing that I just love doing the most just going kicking
205040	209900	around a ball and like doing shooting practice right now you know I love hitting
209900	214160	free kicks I love shooting the ball especially when you have a nice field
214160	218760	like I got that artificial turf on this morning if you're watching my stories but
218760	226520	oh man that was sick you know and I don't know reflection on that though was
226520	232580	more more on like I don't know it's nice going back to something you know it's
232580	239420	like I feel like soccer this is my story with soccer I basically played in
239420	247580	university and like that was sick but I was on the bench okay that was fine like I
247580	250920	don't know I scored one goal whatever I played against like I played with really
250920	255380	good players so like looking back I can't even complain but uh like they were just
255380	263800	better than me at the time and maybe a mental thing but yeah it's nice I just
263800	269040	kind of stopped playing after that like I just just soccer was just like uh I'm
269040	272320	just like so competitive and then it was like that was kind of like I didn't
272320	275520	really have any super competitive soccer so then I took that to golf you know and
275520	279960	I got really into golf for a while and now I'm gonna get really into tennis so
279960	283660	that's kind of my plan it's kind of fun to have a goal like I don't know if I have
